# Let's :poop: all over our commits!

Commits will be commits.
And we have to practically breathe them everyday.

So why not enjoy commiting? :smiley:

As silly as it looks, emojis can cause some really cool visual effects on your commits, helping your fellow developers read and understand what's going on.

## Usage

It's very simple. You just prepend every commit with an emoji:
`:emoji: commit message`.

## Where to start? :confused:
